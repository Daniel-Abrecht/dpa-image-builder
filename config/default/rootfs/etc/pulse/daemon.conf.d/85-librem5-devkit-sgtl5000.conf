# Call audio uses 8 kHz by default.  PulseAudio tries to minimise
# resampling efforts by setting the sample rate of a source/sink to a
# multiple of the input/output's sample rate.  In the case of
# Haegtesse, it tries 48 kHz over 44.1 kHz.  However, the sample rates
# on the SGTL5000 must be the same for both the ADC and DAC.  When
# PulseAudio starts, it queries the SGTL5000's supported sample rates
# for playback and recording separately and then opens the playback
# and record devices with the default sample rate of 44.1 kHz.
# When Haegtesse comes along, it tries to change the sample rate of
# one of the streams to 48 kHz while the other is still open.  This
# fails and causes a lot problems (made worse by the fact that
# PulseAudio "successfully" sets the sample rate on the configuration
# and only later changes the sample rate on the hardware).  To work
# around this, we simply set the default sample rate to 48 kHz so that
# no sample rate change is needed.
